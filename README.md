# HttpClientPlayApp
Demo app to gain a bit more experience with dependency injecting and using IHttpClientFactory and creating a generic data fetcher class. The app uses two endpoints from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. 

Initially I wrote it with a non-generic data fetcher class called ```PostsProcessor```, which I have left in then created a generic processor from it.
